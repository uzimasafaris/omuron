This brief involved numerous townhall meetings with affected employees to discuss favorable compensation restructuring. It also entailed correspondences with government officials in the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development to notify them of the impending mass lay-offs of employees. We also advised on the justification for paying out particular retirement benefits and structuring the Benefits portfolio to align with the Company’s legal and tax obligations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdvisory on Provident Fund Set-Up on behalf of Finance Trust Bank Limited:\u003c/li\u003e\u003cp style='font-size:0.9em; padding-bottom: 10px;'\u003eWe were instructed by the Bank to advise on the legal and regulatory landscape of setting up a retirement benefits scheme for its employees with a portfolio of more than 400 Million.

M Taremwa, we advised Uganda’s Premier Business School on the recrafting of its human resource policies. It was a delicate project that required aligning the School’s Policies to its legal obligations under the Employment legal regime and those under the Universities and Other Tertiary Institutions Act (UOTIA). This project also brought to the fore the delicate relationship between the employment laws and entities whose employees are typically under Uganda’s Public Service. We were able to develop a comprehensive manual to govern the potentially conflicting areas within the spectrum of employer-employee obligations within the context of a Public Higher Education Institution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e",
