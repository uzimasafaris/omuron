M Taremwa, we advised Uganda’s Premier Business School on the recrafting of its human resource policies. It was a delicate project that required aligning the School’s Policies to its legal obligations under the Employment legal regime and those under the Universities and Other Tertiary Institutions Act (UOTIA). This project also brought to the fore the delicate relationship between the employment laws and entities whose employees are typically under Uganda’s Public Service. We were able to develop a comprehensive manual to govern the potentially conflicting areas within the spectrum of employer-employee obligations within the context of a Public Higher Education Institution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e",
